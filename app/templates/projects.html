        <p class="project-summary">
          A project focusing, on a high level, to address the pervasive problem of annoying, unhelpful,
          and even downright harmful ads encountered while watching live TV, such as a sports broadcast.
          The recent surge in unregulated sports betting advertising was an impetus in the creation of
          this project - yes, I'm looking at you, Kevin Hart and LeBron. See
          <a href="https://github.com/RG-O/YoutubeOverCommercials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YoutubeOverCommercials</a>
          for a solution that works quite well. I want this to work even if there is no reliable logo to detect
          on the broadcast, and also to explore how to fight pervasive advertisements using AI in general.
        </p>
        <ul class="project-details">
          <li>Take live transcription and classify sentences into broadcast content or advertisements.</li>    
          <li>Somewhere down the line, incorporate image processing to detect visual advertisements and ad banner boundaires.</li>
          <li>Train a classifier to take this kind of data as input, and hide ads with an overlay and/or muting.</li>             
          <li>Optimize the model enough to the point where it doesn't take a 4000 series NVIDIA GPU to run it.</li>
