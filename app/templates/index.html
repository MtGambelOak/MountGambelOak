        <h2>I like to build things. My main areas of interest are NLP and GIS.</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Utah, expected to graduate Spring 2026
          with a BS in Computer Science and BS in Linguistics. I'm potentially interested in pursuing research
          in NLP. My main areas of interest are studying multilingual performance of LMs, especially in terms
          of increasing multilingual performance with data-poor languages. I'm also interested in model interpretability as a whole.

        <h3>Why go by "GambelDev"?</h3>
        <p>
          People often have the misconception that the name indicates some inclination to gamble on my part.
          I personally don't enjoy lighting my money on fire, so that's actually not the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gambel has been my "gamertag" for quite a while now. It derives from the oak species <em>Quercus gambelii</em>,
          a species of oak native to foothills of many western mountain ranges. Found all over the Wasatch Front,
          this tree is not unlike most oaks in terms of its ecological importance. As my favorite plant, I took
          a liking to its name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Occasionally in writing I refer to myself in the third person as "GambelDev". I hope this doesn't
          give off the impression that I'm some kind of eccentric, it's mostly a stylistic choice I find personally humorous.

        <h3>What's with the seasonal emojis in the footer and favicon?</h3>
        <p>
          Honestly, I just like holidays and getting into a "seasonal mood". I thought adding emojis
          based on the season or holiday would be nice flair for the website. The favicon is sometimes fickle
          in terms of it updating (especially on bookmarks) - this is due to browser caching which can be
          inconsistent among browsers and operating systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be sure to check back regularly to see all the cool different seasonal icons :)
